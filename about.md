This tool allows us to explore how economic conditions vary from state to state, and over time.  Some states are richer while others are poorer - the purpose of this tool is to visualize interstate disparities as measured by economic indicators. 

In particular, we are interested in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Real Personal Income, both in terms of raw numbers and adjusted for state population. **GDP** is a measure of the total economic output of a country (in this case, state), including the value of goods and services produced within its borders. **Personal income** includes compensation from a number of sources, such as salaries, wages, rental receipts from real estate investments. **Real** personal income is adjusted for each state's purchasing price parity. While GDP is often used as a proxy for economic well-being, it doesn't necessarily reflect how that economic output is distributed among its citizens. A high GDP ay not necessarily translate to high incomes; additionally, GDP includes not only income earned by individuals but also profits made by businesses and other organizations. A state with a high GDP may have a relatively small portion of that GDP represented by individual income, depending on how profits are distributed. As such, exploring both GDP and real personal income is relevant for this analysis.
